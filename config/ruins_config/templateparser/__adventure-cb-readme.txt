These templates are created by Jordan Peacock (AKA Jordan_Greywolf) and Wendy Peacock (AKA Kujaku10) via AtomicStryker's Ruins mod for Minecraft.

To use, you will need Minecraft (version 1.12), plus the appropriate version of AtomicStryker's Ruins mod.

For AtomicStryker's Ruins mod:

To use these templates, put the folders in the following Minecraft installation folder (exact path may vary depending upon your installation):

*\.minecraft\config\ruins_config\
(NOTE: THIS IS A CHANGE FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF RUINS.)

If you're asked to merge folders, go ahead.  This will just add the templates to those currently in the affected biomes folders (possibly overwriting older versions of the same templates).

FULL ADVENTURE PACK (Adventure, Command Blocks):
This is my most complete collection of Minecraft Ruins templates.
There may be monsters, there may be traps, there may be treasure, there may be custom-trade villagers, and most assuredly there are going to be lots of Command Blocks.  If that's not what you
prefer, I have alternative versions (sans Command Blocks) at:
http://greywolf.critter.net/minecraft.htm

If you use this pack on a multiplayer server, be sure to enable command blocks in the system properties.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

SPECIAL NOTE for Versions 1.12 and 1.12.1:
Minecraft version 1.12.1 introduces changes to the biome file naming structure -- and Ruins for that version 
introduces new block-weight features.  To accommodate this without having to create a separate ZIP folder for 
versions 1.12 and 1.12.1, I have some redundant biome folders, using the alternative biome names for each 
version.  Templates that only work with 1.12.1 are only included in folders that have 1.12.1-specific folder 
names (so they shouldn't be loaded if you're running Minecraft 1.12).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

File naming conventions:

"JG_" -- templates by Jordan_Greywolf.
"TP_" -- templates by Jordan_Greywolf in the templateparser folder.

"K10_" -- templates by Kujaku10.
"KTP_" -- templates by Kujaku10 in the templateparser folder.

"CB" -- templates that include Command Blocks.
"Seed" -- "Seed" templates that specifically summon OTHER Ruins templates via Command Blocks.
"NOCB" -- alternate version of a template, that does NOT use Command Blocks.
"ADJ" -- templates that use the "adjoining_template" feature to summon other templates (without Command Blocks).

"peaceful" -- alternate version of an existing template minus the traps and monsters.

"BoP" -- Requires Biomes o' Plenty mod.  If you don't have this mod installed, you can delete these templates.
   Otherwise, since they're in a biome folder specific to Biomes o' Plenty, they shouldn't turn up during normal
   terrain generation anyway.
"TF" -- Requires Twilight Forest mod (located in Twilight Forest-specific biome folders).
"Chisel" -- Requires Chisel mod (located in a separate "optional - chisel" folder).  These will need to be moved up
   a level (into the appropriate biome folders) in order to be loaded by Ruins.


"1v12" -- these templates are meant for Minecraft version 1.12.

Usage notes for Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's templates:

If you have a Minecraft modpack including AtomicStryker's Ruins, you are WELCOME to use any or all of our (Kujaku10's and JordanGreywolf's) templates, and to modify them to best fit your setup.  
Please feel free to copy parts of these structures, to borrow ideas for custom mobs, traps, and so forth.  
Some of these templates are specifically intended as "proof-of-concept" to share ideas with other Ruins builders.

If you do include these in a modpack, I'd love to hear about it on the Ruins forum thread or via PM.  :)
